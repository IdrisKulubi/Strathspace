# Likes Functionality Refactor Summary

## Overview
We've refactored the "likes" functionality in the application to use server components, proper caching strategies, and optimized client-side rendering. This approach follows the latest Next.js 15 and React 19 best practices for data fetching and separation of concerns.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Server Component for Data Fetching
- Created a new `LikesModalServer` component that fetches data on the server
- Implemented proper caching using `unstable_cache` with revalidation periods
- Added Suspense for better loading states and streaming

### 2. Enhanced Caching Strategy
- Increased TTL from 60s to 300s (5 minutes) for liked-by-profiles
- Implemented tag-based cache invalidation with `revalidateTag`
- Added specific cache key invalidation for more targeted updates

### 3. Client State for UI Only
- Reduced client state to only what's needed for UI interactions
- Used `removedIds` for immediate UI feedback without waiting for server
- Added `router.refresh()` to trigger revalidation of server data after mutations

### 4. Optimized Server Actions
- Enhanced server actions with targeted cache invalidation
- Improved data revalidation after mutations
- Used proper error handling and feedback

### 5. Dynamic Imports with Suspense
- Used dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size
- Added Suspense fallbacks for better UX during data loading
- Conditional data fetching (only when modal is open)

## Performance Benefits
- Faster initial load times by moving data fetching to the server
- Reduced client-side state and bundle size
- Better caching with smarter invalidation strategies
- Improved perceived performance with optimistic UI updates

## Architecture Improvements
- Clearer separation of concerns (data fetching vs. UI rendering)
- More maintainable code structure
- Better alignment with React Server Components paradigm
- Improved error handling with fallback states

This refactoring demonstrates modern React 19 and Next.js 15 patterns for efficient data fetching and state management, following the principle of "moving data fetching up and state down."
